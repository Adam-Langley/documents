We are constantly getting feedbacks from our customers to improve ASP.NET Zero. Here, **some** of the features will be implemented in the next versions:

-   Tenant **subscription enhancements** (like recurring payments).
-   Customizable **dashboard/widget** system.
-   Improvements on the **Rapid Application Development** tooling.
-   **GraphQL** endpoint.
-   **Webhook** system.
-   Improvements on the **Xamarin** mobile application.
-   **Importing** users.
-   Sending **mass notifications/emails** to users.
-   **Calendar** module.
-   Session timeout & **lock screen**.
-   Option to allow only one **concurrent login** per user.
-   User based **menu customization**.
-   **Improvements** on current features.
-   More **tutorials** and **examples**.

We are adding new items here as we clarify them. All these features and
**much more** will be available also for current customers in their
upgrade period.

Notes:

- Major features are only being developed for ASP.NET Core + jQuery
  and ASP.NET Core + Angular versions beginning from v4.1. See
  [version comparison table](Version-Differences.md) for more.
- The items on road map are subject to change based on customer
  feedbacks and our internal decisions.
